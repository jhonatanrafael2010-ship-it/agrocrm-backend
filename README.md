# My Fullstack App - Backend

This is the backend part of the My Fullstack App project, which is built using Flask. The backend serves as an API that communicates with the React frontend.

## Getting Started

To get started with the backend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-fullstack-app/backend
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask application**:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

The backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /api/example**: An example endpoint to demonstrate communication with the frontend.

## Folder Structure

- `app.py`: The main entry point for the Flask application.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the backend.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
